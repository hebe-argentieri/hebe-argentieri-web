  December 10th 1983 is a turning point in our history, it is remembered as the door that closes to leave terror behind.  Democracy is seen as the opposite of horror and we cling to it in every possible way.

  Even after four decades of incredible advances and painful setbacks, the understanding of our democracy seems to fade between dictionary definitions and reality, institutional frameworks and actual operational systems, truths and post truths, formal power and real power, the untouchable and what can be fiddled with, the awaken cries and the tired silences.

  Restoring our democracy was a long fought battle, as were the many conquests gained during these 40 years. Which were these conquests? How much have we gained and kept? How much have we gained and lost again? How long is there still to go? What battles are still being fought? And which are yet to be started? Is democracy a reality or an endless road towards an ideal to accomplish?

  We were born into a story,  it is our life story. It started far before we were born and was itself initiated by the stories of our parents. All our memories, making up our life story, the nice ones and the painful ones, are moments coming from a state when we were connected. we understand backwards and live forwards, and these memories give us the roots to grow our life on. As artists we are especially obliged to find more memories, to find those memories that are hiding behind known memories, and that sometimes, by themselves, appear and disappear again. sometimes through associations, sometimes through certain moods, and sometimes we can’t even fathom why. Due to the very nature of real creativity – creating the new instead of perpetuating the old mechanical ,same’ – WE need to find those memories – this is the fuel that is necessary for our future new work. Finding those memories, that are still nameless, unknown to us, in ourselves: the missing memories of our future.
  MISSING MEMORIES is proposed by ALLIAGES and curated by Juan Riusech. The exhibition will be shown at Schmuck 2023 (map \#15);

  My present line of work-Terra- reflects upon the effect of Man on Nature. Living in a small agricultural community, I witness the growingly negative effect of unsustainable farming on the environment. Irresponsible use of pesticides, genetically engineered crops, inadequate waste disposal: all of these lead to destruction and disease. In my pieces I combine recycled plastic with metal to depict fields that used to be green but turned black, void, desolate, bearing fruits of pain and blood.

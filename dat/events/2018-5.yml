  Inspired by Margaret Mead ‘s concept that it is culture and not biology that determines one’s individuality, I have worked with the male and female icons-symbols of gender stereotypes- and modified them to show how we change the sex roles assigned to us by society in many different ways. The classic symbols have been re shaped, cut, assembled together and sculpted to give them a new meaning of malleability. ”If we are to achieve a richer culture, rich in contrasting values, we must recognize the whole gamut of human potentialities, and so weave a less arbitrary social fabric, one in which each diverse human gift will find a better place” said Margaret Mead in the 30s and still absolutely true.

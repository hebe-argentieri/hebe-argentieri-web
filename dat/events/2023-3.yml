  SNAG is proud to have hosted this exhibition, organized & curated by Azita Mireshghi and Siavash Jaraiedi.

  The current, women-led revolution in Iran is a reminder of how important it is to fight for freedom. Rev♀luti♀n: Visions of women life freedom was a virtual exhibition of adornment as a powerful political and educational tool, amplifying the voices of those fighting for a free and peaceful life against the Islamic Regime occupying Iran.

  By creating a space for dialogue and reflection, Rev♀luti♀n brought attention to this historical moment through art.

  Rev♀luti♀n highlighted the challenges and sacrifices made for achieving true freedom and equality, to spread awareness and bring about positive change.
